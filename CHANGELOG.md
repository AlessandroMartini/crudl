# CHANGELOG

## 0.4.0 (not yet released)

## 0.3.0 (2017-07-10)

* REMOVED: Connectors were removed from crudl's core. They are now a standalone NPM package. They provide an extensible way to access different APIs (e.g. REST, GraphQl). Currently there are two connector packages available: [basic and general connector package](https://github.com/crudlio/crudl-connectors-base) and [Django REST Framework connectors](https://github.com/crudlio/crudl-connectors-drf).

* NEW: Bulk actions. You can define bulk actions for a list view and thus change (or delete) multiple items at once. Each action may define _before_ or _after_ hooks in order to prepare the action and display the results. Examples of the bulk action include deleting multiple entries or changing the relation (i.e. the foreign key) for selected items.

* REMOVED: Intermediate pages. Intermediate pages were removed and replaced by overlay window. See the next point.

* NEW: Overlay window (having a modal logic). The bulk actions use the overlay window logic in order to implement the _before_ and _after_ hooks.

* NEW: File field for uploads. See [FileField.jsx](./src/fields/FileField.jsx)

* NEW: Checking version compatibility of admin and crudl. It is possible to specify the required crudl version in the admin (e.g. `admin.crudlVersion = '^0.3.0'`) and if the provided crudl version does not match, an error is thrown.

* NEW: You can specify an _admin id_ in the admin file. Any locally persisted user data will be invalidated if the ids do not match. This means, for example, that you can enforce a logout of all users by changing the admin's id.

* CHANGED: Passing props to field components. Every attribute in the field descriptor will be passed to the field component as a prop. You can also provide props dynamically using the field descriptor function `lazy`, which returns an object of props or a promise resolving to such. An example of a field descriptor:
    ```js
    {
        name: 'section',
        label: 'Section',
        field: 'Select',
        lazy: () => options('sections', 'id', 'name').read(crudl.req()),
        helpText: 'Select a section'
    }
    ```
    Where `options` is a connector resolving to `{ options: [ { value: <id>, label: <name> }, ...] }`

    The select field will obtain the prop `options` once the options connector resolves.

* CHANGED: The `field` attribute of a field descriptor can be  either a string or a react component. This allows for custom field components in a direct way:
    ```js
    import { SuggestionField } from './customFields'
    changeView.fields = [
        {
            name: 'section',
            label: 'Section',
            field: SuggestionField,
            // more props...
        }
        // more fields...
    ]
    ```

## 0.2.0 (January 23, 2017)
* NEW: Published npm package (crudl).
* ADDED: Add/edit relations.
* ADDED: Custom messages and enabled translations.
* ADDED: Multiple base API URLs are supported. Connectors can override the default base URL.
* ADDED: Permissions. A user can define per-action permissions in a descriptor or they may be included in an API call response.
* ADDED: Tests (initial) with Jest/Enzyme/Sinon.
* IMPROVED: Removed crudlComponent().
* IMPROVED: WatchComponent removed in favor of props.watch() function and injectPropsWatch() utility.
* IMPROVED: propTypes (using Joi descriptor schema).
* IMPROVED: Folder structure and terminology.
* IMPROVED: Updated redux to 3.6.0.
* IMPROVED: Updated redux-forms to 6.2.0.
* IMPROVED: Using bluebird as promise library.
* IMPROVED: Folder structure.
* CHANGED: Admin stucture (see README.md) and some definitions.
* REMOVED: FieldMap in favor of direct component specification in the field descriptor (see README.md).
